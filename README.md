Kirby Twitter Bot to post Kirby Memes

Originally created by @eduardoescoto using his repo ./twitterBotBoilerPlate. 

Goals:
  1 I aim to automate a new kirby meme post every 6 hours.
  2 Reply to comments saying "hi Kirby" with a special meme, or any other specific strings

Long-Term:
  1 Want it to use Google API to find appropriate Kirby meme's to post that are PG-13
  2 Find other kirby meme pages or kirby related tweets and reply somehow
